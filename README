This tool is *really* quick-and-dirty. I swear youâ€™ve never seen such a crappy
piece of code. This was written to try and find ways to make a TAS tool for
GNU/Linux.

Currently, you can use it to TAS Super Meat Boy. It only has a basic set of
features and most notably lacks save states, but cool stuff can already be done
with it. I plan to implement save states at some point, but for now I have no
efficient solution. Maybe a clever fork() would do the trick? The best solution
would be to mark parts of the memory as copy-on-write and manage the copies as
needed, but the Linux kernel seems to lack direct support for this.

The long term plan is to make a versatile TAS tool for GNU/Linux that would
work with native games and Wine.
